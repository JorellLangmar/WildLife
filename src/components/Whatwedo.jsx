        R.O.A.R. (Reach Out And Rescue) is a conservation charity dedicated to rescuing and preserving the wildlife of Namibia. Originating as a small wildlife sanctuary nestled in the Namibian bush, R.O.A.R. is now a world-famous conservation organisation.

The R.O.A.R. Sanctuary provides a safe haven and second chance for countless injured, orphaned and conflict animals. Wherever possible our aim is to release animals back into the wild.

Our mission is to conserve the land, cultures and wildlife of Namibia, Africa. We aim to achieve this through encouraging participation, education and scientific research.
