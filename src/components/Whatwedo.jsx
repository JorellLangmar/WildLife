          Animals rescued from the illegal wildlife trade are often injured,
          traumatized or orphaned. They are brought to Phnom Tamao Wildlife
          Rescue Center where they receive expert care and attention. No animal
          is turned away. Your sponsorship ensures a happy and healthy future
          for all 1,200 animals that call Phnom Tamao home! Meet some of our
          rescued animals below!
